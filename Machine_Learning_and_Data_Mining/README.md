# Machine Learning and Data Mining Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning and Data Mining Repository! This repository houses a collection of Jupyter Python scripts that demonstrate various applications of Machine Learning and data mining. Originally created as a group project for a university class, these scripts showcase a wide range of data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.

## Scripts:

Below is a brief description of the scripts included in this repository. Many of them offer deeper exploration and additional exercises within their respective themes.

- **Convolutional_NN.ipynb**: This script employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either smiling or not, focusing on smiley faces.

- **Clustering.ipynb** and **Clustering_Preprocessing.ipynb**: These scripts delve into clustering techniques applied to data extracted from Wikipedia.

- **Correlated_Features.ipynb** and **Correlated_Features_Preprocessing.ipynb**: These scripts aim to identify the most correlated features within Wikipedia-extracted data.

- **Decisions_Trees.ipynb**: This script utilizes decision trees to discern the nature of Wikipedia articles.

- **Multilayer_Perceptron.ipynb**: Similar to the first script, this one employs a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify images of smiling faces.

- **Regression.ipynb**: This script covers Linear and Logistic regression applied to both Wikipedia data and smiley face image data.

- **wikipedia_page_data_fetcher.py**: This Python script extracts and preprocesses data from the articles folder, making it suitable for further data experimentation.

## Folders:

The repository contains the following folders:

- **articles**: This folder holds the raw Wikipedia articles.

- **src**: In this folder, you will find the smiley face images used in the CNN scripts, as well as the processed Wikipedia data used in other scripts.

## Dataframes (df):

Throughout these scripts, dataframes (df) are utilized to manipulate and feed data into the Machine Learning algorithms, providing a structured and efficient approach to data analysis and model training.
